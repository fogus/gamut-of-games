GOAL   To have the most points in pawn (1pt each) and court (2pts each) cards
       when the game ends.

DECK   An extended Decktet deck with the pawns, courts, and The Excuse
       separated from the rest. Shuffle the pawns and courts together and
       set aside face down. One player says "pawn" or "court" and the top
       card is drawn. If it's the same as what the player said then they
       may choose to be either the 1st or 2nd player. The 2nd player is
       then given The Excuse and the previously drawn card is placed at
       the bottom of the pawn/court pile. The base cards are then shuffled
       thoroughly and placed away from the pawn/court pile.
 
DEAL   Deal 3 cards from the draw deck to each player. Then 3 cards are
       drawn from the pawn/court pile and placed face up between the players.

PLAY
    
On a player's turn they must take the following two actions, in order:

  - Draw a card from the top of draw deck
  
  - Take one action

The possible actions are as follows:

* Draw an extra card from the top of draw deck or the top of the discard pile
* Trade in cards
* Capture a pawn/court card
* Steal a pawn/court card

More information for these actions are as follows:

/Draw/

The simplest action is to draw another card in addition to the initial mandatory draw. There is a 10-card hand size limit, but you may go over this limit using your draw actions. If at any time the draw pile is empty then the discard pile is shuffled and placed as the new draw pile.
