GOAL   To have the most points in pawn (1pt each) and court (2pts each) cards
       when the game ends.

DECK   An extended Decktet deck with the pawns, courts, and The Excuse
       separated from the rest. Shuffle the pawns and courts together and
       set aside face down. One player says "pawn" or "court" and the top
       card is drawn. If it's the same as what the player said then they
       may choose to be either the 1st or 2nd player. The 2nd player is
       then given The Excuse and the previously drawn card is placed at
       the bottom of the pawn/court pile. The base cards are then shuffled
       thoroughly and placed away from the pawn/court pile.
 
DEAL   Deal 3 cards from the draw deck to each player. Then 3 cards are
       drawn from the pawn/court pile and placed face up between the players.
